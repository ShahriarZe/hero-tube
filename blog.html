                <p class="text-2xl">Scope defines the place or boundary where we can access/get the variables and
                    functions defined.Variables declared with 'Var' are function scoped on the other hand 'let' &
                    'Const' are block scoped.If we declare a variable with 'Var' we can declare it again and also
                    re-assign it's value.Secondly if we declare with 'Let' we can't declare it again but re-assign it's
                    value.Lastly if we declare with 'Const' we can't declare or re-assign it's value.The main difference
                    between 'Let' and 'Const' is immutability.We can say, 'Var' should be avoided in modern JavaScript
                    because of its function or global scope, Instead, it is recommended to use 'Let' & 'Const'.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p class="text-2xl">'Null' is usually used to explicitly indicate the absence of a value, or to set
                    variables or properties to have no value.'Undefined' often occurs when the variable is declared,
                    uninitialized, or when the function does not explicitly return a value.In short 'Undefined' means
                    the value hasn't been set,whereas 'Null' means the value has been set to be empty.In JavaScript,
                    both 'Null' and 'Undefined' serve specific purposes, each with its own use case.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p class="text-2xl">A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a
                    set of rules and conventions for creating and interacting with web services on the Internet.REST
                    APIs are designed to be simple, scalable, and stateless, making them well-suited to a wide range of
                    applications and devices.REST APIs use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.In
                    short we can say, a REST API is a standardized way for different software systems to communicate and
                    exchange data over the Internet.</p>
